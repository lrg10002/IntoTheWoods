# IntoTheWoods
A humorous console-based role-playing game

## To-Do
* Create a system in which the game tree can be expanded into text files
* Create a console program which indicates which game points have not yet been added
* Implement "typewriter" output
* Implement better timing (maybe enter-controlled?)
* Implement different ways of printing such that conversations can be printed within statements
* Add support for choosing from a list of random statements
